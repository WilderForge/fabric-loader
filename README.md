# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ WARNING — CUSTOM BRANCH FOR MULTIMYTH ONLY ⚠️⚠️⚠️

> 🛑 **DO NOT use this branch for regular Fabric mod development.**  
> 🧪 This branch is **custom-modified** and intended **only for [MultiMyth](https://github.com/WilderForge/MultiMyth)**.  
> 🕵️ It enables **mod detection without launching the game**, which is not part of the standard Fabric loader.  
> 🔀 **The version number does not match the official Fabric Loader.**  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: `0.16.15+WilderForge` is based on official Fabric Loader `0.16.14`.

### ✅ If you're using:
